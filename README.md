# Oxide

An implementation of Oxide as described in [_Oxide: The Essence of Rust_][arxiv].

## Background

To get a sense of the terminology and why the semantics is structured how it is (i.e. into levels),
I highly recommend reading [Niko's post about observational equivalence in Rust][obseq]. This should
at least be sufficient to understand why we're talking about levels of Rust, but it may well provide
other useful insights as well. [Niko's recent work on non-lexical lifetimes][nll] features some key
similarities to our approach, and may aid in its understanding.

## Terminology

- _Safe Rust_ — the core of Rust, without _any_ unsafe code.
- _Language level_ — a combination of _safe Rust_ and a set of _unsafe abstractions_ that increase
  the overall expressivity of the language, e.g. Rust1 is _safe Rust_ + `Vec<T>`.
- _Unsafe abstraction_ — an abstraction that cannot be implemented in _safe Rust_ (absolute) or the
  current _language level_ (relative) without the use of Rust's `unsafe` block.
- _Lifetime_ — the span of time from when a value is allocated to when it is deallocated.
- _Region_ — the space on the stack where a value is allocated for its _lifetime_ (see also:
  [`why-regions.md`](history/notes/why-regions.md)).

## Navigating this repository

This repository is split into six parts:

1. [`history/`](history/) — largely-iterative prior attempts at building & designing Oxide
    - [`ownershipv1`](history/ownershipv1.md) and [`ownershipv2`](history/ownershipv2.md) both have
      some notes included that might be insightful to some degree. Evidently, I got lazy afterward
      and stopped writing actual prose in the models. Afterward, I switched to LaTeX.
2. [`history/notes/`](history/notes/) — an assorted selection of my old notes
3. [`history/examples/`](history/examples/) — a collection of old examples (and counter-examples) at each level
    - Each example is in "proper" Rust syntax for that level _and_ its corresponding `oxide` form at the time.
4. [`oxide/`](oxide/) — an implementation of Oxide in OCaml
    - Currently, it's just the type checker, but we will eventually have an interpreter too.
    - We require OCaml 4.08 for user-defined binding form support.
5. [`reducer/`](reducer/) — a desugarer (simple compiler) from (a subset of) Rust to Oxide
    - Run reducer with `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg procmacro2_semver_exempt'` for source filename tracking.
6. [`runner/`](runner/) — a test harness for driving the reducer/typechecker. 
    - This requires the following opam packages:
    `opam install opam shexp stdio yojson utop ppx_deriving`
